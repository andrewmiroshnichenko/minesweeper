Built on React and Polymer.
Basic toolbox is React one, which can be installed with
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
And than custom Polymer component has been added through ctrl-c/ctrl-v.

Width and height are limited to not exceed 40 squares each. This is done because of performance issues with high amount of squares.
Mines marks can be placed(and eventually removed) using ctrl+click.
